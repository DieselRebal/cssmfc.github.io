### About
The Invoice template is using HTML content based with editable areas. Simple to use, no coding skills, no hosting. Type, upload and Save.
* It supports adding image file as invoice logo - suggested size is 180x150 w/h
* Works offline (clone and download/save this project). It can run locally on your machine and does not use hosting because the logo is seved in browser session so if you refresh the page, all editing will be lost.
