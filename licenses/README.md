### Fonts license
Some of our works use embaded fonts (MicroFLF, MicroFLF Extended for example) were found on the internet and did not come with a license. There are many fonts that have either been abandoned by their authors or the authors distribute their fonts without an explicit license.

It is our opinion that if the unlicensed font is freely available for download from either the original source or from multiple free-font sites then we assume it to be safe to use the font commercially. This is no guarantee of such freedom, but there are so many unlicensed free fonts distributed by primary sources that the intentions must be read that the font is free to use how you like.

*Note: The content of this section is based on the entry from fAQ page of FontSquirrel.com, one of the many places this particular font is available for free online download.*

### Graphics license
Graphic components and other images.
The visual aspect of some of our works are depicting people (individuals), objects, graphic elements like background images, buttons, banners, animations.
All images which are not created by us come from online environment and they can be used for commercial purpose.
The best sources of free stock (materials/photos) is Pixabay.com (or at least this is our best place for media resources)
